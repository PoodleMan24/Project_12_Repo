# Project_12_Repo
Baileys UWA Submission for Module 12 challenge
For this project we were given these instructions:

### Instructions
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

I used a combination of Mongosh, Mongo and Pymongo to edit and navigate a .json file provided. The NoSQL_startup_setup.ipynb is required to be run first as it sets the database in mongo up for the NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb work.
